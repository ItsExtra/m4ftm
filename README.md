# m4ftm.com

This GitHub project is here to assist in the development of m4ftm.com. It is just to help with the planning and organization. None of the files for that site are directly hosted here and for the time being the content is not being edited on github, though I'm open to changing that if I could figure out how to do it. 

## Share your thoughts

Although GitHub calls them **issues**, we'd like you to think of them as **conversation starters**. They're our way of communicating across all the members of the team.

* [![Question](https://img.shields.io/badge/-question-cc317c.svg)][link_question] These issues are questions and represent a great place to start. Whomever has opened the issue wants to hear from you!


* [![Good First Bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20bug-5319e7.svg)][link_goodfirstbug] These issues contain a task that anyone with any level of experience can help with.
