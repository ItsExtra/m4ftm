# m4ftm

I’m collaborating with trans and cis gay, bi and queer men to enrich gay male sex to be inclusive of trans masuline experiences.

## Documents

[The minimum required to make a public release](https://github.com/ItsExtra/m4ftm/wiki/The-minimum-required-to-make-a-public-release): This working document attempts to lay out a short term roadmap to get this project to its first release. 

[Principals & Goals](https://github.com/ItsExtra/m4ftm/wiki/Principals-&-Goals): Describes the basic goals of the site, target audience and scope. Attempts to anticipate requests and offers from outside parties such as relating to conducting research and giving us money (ya right). Some guidance for contributors on writing style.

[Assumptions to keep in mind when writing](https://github.com/ItsExtra/m4ftm/wiki/Assumptions): Decsribes the attitude the site should take reagrding cis guys and trans guys. 

[Guideline: Financials](https://github.com/ItsExtra/m4ftm/wiki/Guideline:-Financials): Outlines our financial accountability to the public and suggests restrictions on accepting financial or in-kind donations

[Guideline: Academic & market research](https://github.com/ItsExtra/m4ftm/wiki/Guideline:-Academic-&-market-research)

## GitHub

This GitHub project is here to assist in the development of m4ftm.com ([development site](https://eggplant.m4ftm.com/wp/)). It is just to help with the planning and organization. None of the files or code for that site are hosted here and the content is not being edited on github, though I'm open to changing that if I could figure out how to do it. 

I am by no means committedd to GitHub and ultimately would like to move to another platform as there are ethical issues with this one. 

## Seeking input and collaborators 

Currently this is a one person project. I do not anticipate this being the situation long term. However I want to get things under a certain amount of control and have some clarity as to the actual project before hitting up strangers for their time and energy. 

There is no way that I have sufficient knowledge to complete this project on my own. Since it is inherently a project about groups of people, it cannot be written by a single person. At least not by *this* single person.

In the long run, it would be great if there were people who could do things that I either cannot do at all or struggle to do (and even then not very well): 
* need more and better writing (completely non comprehensive list can be found in Issues: [ 💻 Writing needed 📑 ](link_Writing-needed))
* create original illustrations and graphics
* original photography and modelling 
* Videos like vlogs, documentary type etc
* XXX videos and pics
* Social media maintenence: twitter, IG, kik, fb, tumblr, whatever else people are using
* Make and implement a promotional plan
* More sophisticated coding than what I can clobber together from wordpress components 
* Other stuff I haven't even thought of; but hopefully someone will!

## Milestones

There is a very, very rought timeline in the "[Milestones](https://github.com/ItsExtra/m4ftm/milestones)".
