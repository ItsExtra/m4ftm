# ISO collaboaration and feedback

I am seeking collaborators on this project. This can be either locally (I'm in Toronto, Canada) or further away. I am open to a variety of levels of engagement from proof-reader to co-admin.

In particular some "peer review" would be helpful regarding the content. I tried my best to include all the main kinds of sex I have seen mentioned on websites and apps, but some of them I am much less familiar with that others, so I just did my best. If you have insight into any of the following, which I'm especially weak on, I'd love to hear from you:

  * [Topping](http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/bottoming-to-a-trans-guy/) _as_ a trans man, especially [strap ons](http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/getting-fucked-in-the-ass-by-a-trans-man/) and [bjs](http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/sucking-a-trans-mans-dick/)
  * Bottoming _to_ a trans man in any capacity
  * Anything from cis guys that I can't notice because of my perspective

If there is anything I straight up missed I'd also like to know about it. With a couple of exceptions for completeness, I am trying to limit this _only_ to acts where there might conceivably be a knowledge gap. I also decided not to go for every fetish under the sun, although there is a special page about [kinky sex](http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/kinky-sex-with-trans-guys/) (am I missing anything there?), again not all of which I have experience with.

If you are interested in collaborating, here are some things that

  * Write content
  * Edit, proofread etc
  * Provide feedback on content (peer review), brainstorm ideas for writing
  * Make existing content more interesting by finding and adding images, videos, links etc
  * Manage social media and promotion
  * Translation
  * Create other kinds of content: videos, art, podcast etc
