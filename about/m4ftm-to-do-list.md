# m4ftm To Do List

I've been getting some really good feedback from folks on this site and am working to integrate the ideas. Here is a summary of specific things I plan to work on with their statuses.

  * A page about language, particularly with regards to body parts. Eg cock vs clit. I have most of a draft about this in progress. It will be called "talking dirty to trans men" (Suggested by basically everyone who sent feedback)
  * Something about binders. Not sure where this will fit yet.
  * Page about homologus anatomy, started but not adequate. Hoping for assistance on this.
  * Update the page on genderqueers and other IDs. I am not the right person to do this, so I await assistance.
  * Orgasms: what they are, what they look like. Not started, currently gathering feedback and ideas.
  * It seems like talking more about men who've had surgeries to their junk might be in order, but I don't know much about this, so I await assistance.
  * Sites to link to: [Trans fag sex journals](http://transfagssexjournals.blogspot.ca/)
