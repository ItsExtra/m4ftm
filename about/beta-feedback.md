This website is currently been circulated within the trans male communities for feedback before &#8220;launching&#8221;. Feedback is being sought and acted upon (even if you do not ID as a trans man). I will respond by your prefered method of contact if provided. Here are a few questions to get you thinking:

  * What do you think of the concept of this site?
  * How accurate and inclusive is the information provided?
  * What is missing? What sections should be expanded?
  * What do you think of the tone and style of the site?
  * Is there anyone you would recommend as a contributor, collaborator or to whom I should otherwise reach out?
  * Were there any technical or design aspects you had trouble with? Is it easy to find what you want?
  * How well does it convey the required information to the target audience?
  * Is the language understandable? Did I let any jargon slip in without explaining it?
  * If you are a cis man, does it make you feel any different about trans men?
  * If you are a trans man, would you share this with a cis guy you wanted to fuck? What could make it more helpful?
