# BETA Feedback

This website is currently been circulated within the trans male communities for feedback before "launching". Feedback is being sought and acted upon (even if you do not ID as a trans man). I will respond by your preferred method of contact if provided. Here are a few questions to get you thinking:

  * What do you think of the concept of this site?
  * How accurate and inclusive is the information provided?
  * What is missing? What sections should be expanded?
  * What do you think of the tone and style of the site?
  * Is there anyone you would recommend as a contributor, collaborator or to whom I should otherwise reach out?
  * Were there any technical or design aspects you had trouble with? Is it easy to find what you want?
  * How well does it convey the required information to the target audience?
  * Is the language understandable? Did I let any jargon slip in without explaining it?
  * If you are a cis man, does it make you feel any different about trans men?
  * If you are a trans man, would you share this with a cis guy you wanted to fuck? What could make it more helpful?

Thank you!!
