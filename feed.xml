<h2 id="mcetoc_1dl0lsuha0">Feedback is being sought and acted upon (even if you do not ID as a trans man). I will respond by your preferred method of contact if provided. Here are a few questions to get you thinking:</h2>
<ul>
<li>What do you think of the concept of this site?</li>
<li>How accurate and inclusive is the information provided?</li>
<li>What is missing? What sections should be expanded?</li>
<li>What do you think of the tone and style of the site?</li>
<li>Is there anyone you would recommend as a contributor, collaborator or to whom I should otherwise reach out?</li>
<li>Were there any technical or design aspects you had trouble with? Is it easy to find what you want?</li>
<li>How well does it convey the required information to the target audience?</li>
<li>Is the language understandable? Did I let any jargon slip in without explaining it?</li>
<li>If you are a cis man, does it make you feel any different about trans men?</li>
<li>If you are a trans man, would you share this with a cis guy you wanted to fuck? What could make it more helpful?</li>

<p id="mcetoc_1dl0d55d90">I am open to a variety of levels of engagement from proof-reader to co-admin.</p>
<p>In particular some "peer review" would be helpful regarding the content. I tried my best to include all the main kinds of sex I have seen mentioned on websites and apps, but some of them I am much less familiar with that others, so I just did my best. If you have insight into any of the following, which I'm especially weak on, I'd love to hear from you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/bottoming-to-a-trans-guy/">Topping</a> <em>as</em> a trans man, especially <a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/getting-fucked-in-the-ass-by-a-trans-man/">strap ons</a> and <a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/sucking-a-trans-mans-dick/">bjs</a></li>
<li>Bottoming <em>to</em> a trans man in any capacity</li>
<li>Anything from cis guys that I can't notice because of my perspective</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is anything I straight up missed I'd also like to know about it. With a couple of exceptions for completeness, I am trying to limit this <em>only</em> to acts where there might conceivably be a knowledge gap. I also decided not to go for every fetish under the sun, although there is a special page about <a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/kinky-sex-with-trans-guys/">kinky sex</a> (am I missing anything there?), again not all of which I have experience with.</p>
<p>If you are interested in collaborating, here are some things that need to be done</p>
<ul>
<li>Write content</li>
<li>Edit, proofread etc</li>
<li>Provide feedback on content (peer review), brainstorm ideas for writing</li>
<li>Make existing content more interesting by finding and adding images, videos, links etc</li>
<li>Manage social media and promotion</li>
<li>Translation</li>
<li>Create other kinds of content: videos, art, podcast etc</li>
</ul>

<li>Orgasms: what they are, what they look like. Not started, currently gathering feedback and ideas.</li>
<li>It seems like talking more about men who've had surgeries to their junk might be in order, but I don't know much about this, so I await assistance.</li>
