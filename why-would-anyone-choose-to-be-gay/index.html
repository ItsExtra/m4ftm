               <p>It makes me sad to hear this, especially when it comes from men who seem to be otherwise "out and proud." The kernel of self-loathing which is the foundation of this question is evident. It's basically saying (and I've heard this said aloud too) "I would never, ever choose to be gay, but since I am I will make the best of it."</p>
<p>I do not think homosexuality and gender diversity are defects, I think they are part of the natural variance in humans and the vast majority of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>I like being gay. I knew I was going to be gay many years before I understood how transition worked, and that I could be a man. When I was a kid, I was really puzzled why I wasn't attracted to girls. I actually tried pretty hard. I felt I should be. Gay. I was gay. But  I wasn't even a little bit bisexual. I kept thinking of myself as gay. I had the gayest sex I could with the str8 boys available to me. I loved bi guys, that felt much more legit.</p>
<p>Now I get to be gay, which is wonderful in some ways, although it can be lonely at times</p>
