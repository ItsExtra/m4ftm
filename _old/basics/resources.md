It was first published in 2007, and updated in 2015. Based on an Ontario-wide assessment of the sexual health needs of gay, bi and queer trans men, Primed prioritizes our diverse bodies, desires, and sexualities. This resource will spark discussion about the many ways that trans men have sex and how we interact with our gay/queer men's communities.

Topics covered in the guide include: disclosure, finding sex and cruising, safer sex and harm reduction, HIV and other STIs, and more!

(Local to San Francisco) <a href="http://www.apiwellness.org/tm4m.html">tm4m </a>is a group for transmen who play with men (or want to&#8230;) and the men who play with us.

Our goal is to provide information, education and support to trans men who have sex with men. To do this, we put on monthly educational workshops and discussion groups, publish informational materials and continuously work to foster acceptance and build community.

tm4m is a collaborative effort co-sponsored by Eros, Trannywood Pictures and TRANS: THRIVE (a program of the Asian & Pacific Islander Wellness Center).
