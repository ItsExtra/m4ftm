Some trans men like to play with vibrat

For the most part, vibrators are for the outside of the body, not the inside. Some of them are specifically designed in such a way that they cannot comfortably or safely be inserted, but most can be if you want to. Ask your partner if that's something he would enjoy. But your best bet is to apply a vibe to the glansÂ either directly or through the hood. You can try rubbing it on the labia. Vibrators are pretty personal in terms of preferences, so once again the easiest is to just ask your partner to show you what he wants.
