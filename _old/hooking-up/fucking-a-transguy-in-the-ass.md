# Fucking a transguy in the ass

An FTM's ass works almost the same way as a cis (non trans) man's ass.

Trans men don't have prostates, so there's no point looking for that special spot. This does not stop lots of trans guys from _loving_ having their assholes ploughed. In some positions you might be able to hit the G spot, which is located on the front wall of the cunt two or three inches up.

Just like all other men, trans guys have different feelings and preferences when it comes to being fucked in the ass.  You can talk to a trans guy about his ass the same way you would talk to any guy.
