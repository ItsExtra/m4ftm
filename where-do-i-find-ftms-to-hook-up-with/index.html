Whatever apps or cruising sites are popular in your area can have trans men. There are more trans folks in places than others.</p><h2>Identify yourself as friendly</h2><p>Not all trans men state their status on their profiles. Being trans is a private fact for some people, and for various reasons they don’t want to put the info with their picture or other info. Others have their trans status prominently displayed and in some contexts may tell you some of the historical/medical stuff you want to know to get with them right on the profile. Some trans men will drop hints in their profiles by saying things like “I’m not your typical guy” which of course could be referring to something else.</p><p>If you are open to encounters with trans guys, put something like “ftm friendly” or “trans positive” in your profile. It will be noticed. I honestly think this is the best strategy. Try the passive route for a while before becoming more aggressive in your search, because it’s easy to rub people the wrong way.</p><p>Putting notes like that on your profile also shows other guys that you are not embarrassed to fuck trans men, which helps change the atmosphere in the gay and MSM communities to one which is more friendly towards us.</p><h2>Meeting in person</h2><p>In some big cities (maybe even some smaller ones) there are places you can go where you stand a better chance of meeting a trans guy. Some gay/lesbian bars have regular trans fag nights. There also might be certain bars which are known to be friendly to trans men where you are more likely to find them. There are also branches and other sort of meet-up groups. <a href="http://fetlife.com/">Fetlife</a> is a good place to look (you’ll need an account).</p><p>If you do decide to actively look for trans guys, don’t be a fucking weirdo about it. Play it cool. Don’t fuck a trans man if there is <a href="https://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/reasons-to-not-fuck-an-ftm/">a reason you shouldn’t be</a>. Even if you are a fabulous person who is definitely not a creeper, be aware that there are a lot of creepers hanging around some of these places, and folks might have their back up. Don’t take it personally. Try to take any constructive feedback you get and apply it to your future behaviour.</p><h2>Apps and websites</h2><ul><li>Adam4Adam</li><li>Scruff</li><li>Grindr</li><li>Dudesnude</li><li>Recon (fetish)</li><li>Manhunt</li><li><del>Craigslist</del></li><li>Fetlife (“the facebook of sex”)</li><li>OkCupid (more of a dating website)</li></ul><p>Tinder has <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/06/05/tinder-allegedly-banning-transgender-users-because-theyre-trans">gone out of its way</a> to deny service to trans people so trans guys may either be unable to use it or unwilling. You might find some there though.</p><h2>Outside links</h2><p><a href="http://charlesasher.blogspot.ca/2012/08/ftm-dating-sites.html">FTM dating sites</a></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on Sep 17, 2019</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/where-can-i-find-ftm-porn/" class="inverse">Where can I find FTM porn?</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-17T19:23" class="u-small">Sep 17, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/index_hooking-up/" class="inverse">(index) Hooking up with FTMs</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-17T19:22" class="u-small">Sep 17, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/"><img src="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/media/website/170605-icon-150px.png" alt="m4ftm"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="m4ftm" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p><p>creative commons something something</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=07b53ae91f8045eab042a695e4a26034"></script></body></html>
