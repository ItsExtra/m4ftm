There are many reasons for this, but at the end of the day a person’s health information is private. Some ways you could accidentally upset someone:</p><ul><li>Referring to someone as “my trans friend” or something like that</li><li>Revealing a past name to someone who didn’t know it (this is called <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=deadname">deadnaming</a>)</li><li>Telling all your friends you dated or hooked up with a trans guy, who they will later meet and be able to figure it out</li></ul><p>If you think you might need to tell anyone, including your boyfriend or your BFF, about a trans person’s status for any reason (even if it’s just to tell them how goddamned smokin hot the sex was), you should mention it to him and find out what his boundaries are. He will probably understand that you just can’t keep quiet, but might ask that you keep the information away from certain people or groups, like someone who is connected to their job, or who is shitty some how. Or he might not care. Some trans people are completely open about their health history.</p><h2>But don’t go into the closet yourself</h2><p>And don’t drag him in there with you. If you are seeing someone who is known in your social circles to be trans, don’t be embarrassed about it. Don’t hide that fact. It is a real bummer to feel like you are a shameful secret. It’s like straight men who date big women but don’t want their friends to know, Its just shitty. Man up.</p><h2>The gay closet vs trans privacy</h2><p>Being “out” about being trans is different than being “out” about being gay. Being out as gay is about your social, economic, familial, sexual and political relationships. These art part of a person’s public life, their place in the collective, which are difficult and uncomfortable to separate.</p><p>Being trans though, is a private thing. It is about how we relate to ourselves, and how we want people to relate to us. Trans people spend a lot of time, money and frequently take great personal risks and losses to get ourselves to the right place, to be seen the way we want. Some of us don’t want that part of our story preceding us. It’s intimate.</p><p>Some people are “out” in some parts of their life but not others. If you don’t know for a fact that a trans person is comfortable with their status known but someone else, don’t share.</p><h2>Things you shouldn’t say or ask</h2><p>Here are some things that most trans people will find rude or icky. If you need more explanation, see GLAAD’s <a href="http://www.glaad.org/transgender/allies">Tips for allies of transgender people</a>.</p><ul><li>“What is you real/birth/old/legal <strong>name</strong>?”</li><li>“Can I see a <strong>photo</strong> of you before you transitioned?”</li><li>“You look <strong>just like</strong> a man!” “I couldn’t even <strong>tell</strong> you were trans.”</li><li>“Have you had the <strong>surgery</strong>?” (read more <a href="https://m4ftm.com/basics/what-is-transition/">about transition</a> to learn why this question doesn’t make any sense)</li><li>If you aren’t in a context where you need to know, like because you are thinking of hooking up, and he’s not asking you about your junk, <strong>don’t ask him</strong> about his bodies, health history or other private business</li><li>Try not to make <strong>assumptions</strong> about his mental health, history, or struggles</li><li>“Your so <strong>brave</strong>“, “I could never be so strong” “I admire you” these are nice things to say to someone, but not <em>just</em> because they are trans</li><li>Don’t assume he is “<strong>trapped</strong> in a woman’s body,” or “<strong>hates</strong> his body” that’s not something everyone (or even many people) feel</li><li>Anything about “<strong>best of both worlds</strong>“—I don’t know if this universal, but I personally find this extremely off-putting</li><li>If you don’t know someone well enough to be 100% sure they are OK with it, avoid questions about our <strong>personal history</strong> as it relates to gender, “did you always feel different from the other kids?” “did you ever try to kill yourself?” “when did you know you were trans?”</li><li>Which <strong>bathroom</strong> do you use?</li><li>How do you <strong>piss</strong>? (Acceptable if you are looking for some <a href="https://m4ftm.com/how-do-you-fuck-a-trans-guy/kinky-sex-with-trans-guys/">water sports</a>!)</li></ul><p>If you aren’t sure if something is OK to ask or say, try to think of another thing that would be the same level of intrusiveness, intimacy on another issue. If you just met someone you know to be trans and are curious about their medical history or surgical status, imagine if you just met someone you know has children. Do you ask them how the birth went? Was it vaginal or C-section? Was an epidural used? What the copulation passionate or perfunctory? Unless you are in a situation where that’s topical, like a new mother’s group, or someone you are already really close with, it would be considered rude. So if you are on a hookup site, you can ask about someone’s body, because everyone is asking each other about their bodies. But if you are at your niece’s 5th birthday party and a trans neighbour comes by for a piece of cake, you’ll just have hold your questions.</p><h2>If you make a mistake</h2><p>Nobody’s perfect. I have mispronouned (using “she” instead of “he” when for some reason referring to myself in the third person) <em>myself</em> out of habit. Just apologize, move on and don't do it again.</p><h2>The word tranny</h2><p>Tranny is a word you should not use. Some people have reclaimed it, but just like you probably don’t like being called faggot by straight people, you shouldn’t use reclaimed words if you are not a member of the target group. Also, it is a word that has historically been used to describe trans women, often in the context of extreme violence, so if you ask me, trans men have no business “reclaiming” it. Unless you are a trans woman you should wash the word from your vocabulary.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Trans men and other trans people are just people and we want to be treated the same way other people are.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on Sep 17, 2019</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/what-if-i-say-something-wrong/#disqus_thread" data-disqus-identifier="31" class="u-comment-count" rel="nofollow">0</a></footer></article><div class="comments box"><h3 class="box__title">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
