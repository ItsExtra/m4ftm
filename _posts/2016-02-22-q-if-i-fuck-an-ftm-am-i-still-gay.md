# Q: If I fuck an FTM am I still gay?

Do you have to be at least a _little_ bit bi to fuck, or want to fuck a trans guy? Some gold star gays think you do.

I am of course biased, but I disagree.&nbsp;You just have to be attracted to him, and he has to be attracted to you. Trans men are men.&nbsp;It's how we see ourselves and for the most part it's how other people see us. We have different stories and bodies, but so does everyone.

It seems to me that gay men can have a sort of knee jerk reaction to trans men, especially if they had never considered the idea in relationship to their own bodies. Taking a moment to think about the concept in general, and the cute guy in front of you, might open a new door. Keep reading this website to learn more about this.

**Who cares?**

You came out as gay, so you know you are capable of standing up for your desires in the face of other people's labels. Instead of fitting your behaviour to match a label, why not behave how you feel?

**Another point of view**

Cartoonist and gold star gay Bill Roundy drew his experiences [in a comic](http://comics.billroundy.com/?p=1116). Here's one panel, but you should read the whole thing if this is still troubling you.
