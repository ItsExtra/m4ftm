Do you have to be at least a _little_ bit bi to fuck, or want to fuck a trans guy? Some gold star gays think you do.

I am of course biased, but I disagree.&nbsp;You just have to be attracted to him, and he has to be attracted to you. Trans men are men.&nbsp;It&#8217;s how we see ourselves and for the most part it&#8217;s how other people see us. We have different stories and bodies, but so does everyone.

It seems to me that gay men can have a sort of knee jerk reaction to trans men, especially if they had never considered the idea in relationship to their own bodies. Taking a moment to think about the concept in general, and the cute guy in front of you, might open a new door. Keep reading this website to learn more about this.

**Who cares?**

You came out as gay, so you know you are capable of standing up for your desires in the face of other people&#8217;s labels. Instead of fitting your behaviour to match a label, why not behave how you feel?

**Another point of view&nbsp;**

Cartoonist and gold star gay Bill Roundy drew his experiences [in a comic](http://comics.billroundy.com/?p=1116). Here&#8217;s one panel, but you should read the whole thing if this is still troubling you.
