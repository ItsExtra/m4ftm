<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>8 Outrageous Things Gay Men Say to Trans Men </p><p>As a bisexual trans man who passes, I deal with a lot of "surprise"  reactions from all sorts of people when I reveal my status. When it  comes to sexual and romantic interactions — from dance parties to apps —  a majority of the time I have to do a little trans 101. Cisgender gay  men seem to lack an understanding of trans etiquette and manners.<br> Of course, I've dated a few lovely cis gay men, but 8 out of 10  times, our conversations lack dignity on their end. Here are eight  outrageous things gay cis men say to trans men. </p><cite>https://www.pride.com/transgender/2015/10/23/outrageous-things-gay-cis-men-say-trans-men </cite></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>My friend is a gay-identified FTM. He’s hot, he’s cute, and above the  waist, you would never guess what he’s got down below. We love to kiss  and cuddle, and from my end, his blowjobs are great. The problem is that  I have no idea how to reciprocate. He isn’t into anal (why would he be,  without a prostate?), there’s no cock for me to suck, and what he does  have down below doesn’t interest either of us.<br>    <br>Do you have any ideas on how I could turn him on and get him  off? It’s starting to frustrate me. Getting bottom work done is a long  way off with the current finances.</p><cite><a href="https://www.straight.com/life/savage-love-column">Savage Love Column</a> > <a href="https://www.straight.com/life/lets-talk-about-ftm-sex">Let's talk about FTM sex</a></cite></blockquote>
