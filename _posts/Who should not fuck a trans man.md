# Who should not fuck a trans man?

After all this writing about why and how to fuck trans men, I&#8217;d like to bring things down a bit and mention some situations where you should maybe reconsider, because you risk ruining someone else&#8217;s day.

**You&#8217;d be better off with a blow up doll**

While some enjoy it, many trans people find it off-putting when they feel the only thing a person is interested in is their weird body. Figure out what _else_ you like about them. While I find it weird when someone doesn&#8217;t want to fuck me just cause of my junk, it&#8217;s actually much weirder when that is literally the _only_ thing they want. Before I learned to identify these guys, I had some really bad sex.

Don&#8217;t treat a trans person like a kinky walk on the wild side, unless that&#8217;s something they&#8217;re into. I bet that very few trans people enjoy being thought of us taboo or wild just because of their bodies.

**You feel like you should**

Maybe you heard about how transphobic cis (non trans) gay guys are and have decided you will do right by your community and fuck a trans person. Wasting a trans guys time so you can use him like a fleshlight, think of someone you actually want to fuck, and check something off your bucket list is not fun for the other people. I have now learned how to filter these people out after some really abysmal sex.

**You can&#8217;t wait to tell your friends**

If you are hoping to hook up with a trans guy so you can show your friends how progressive you are, wait until you find someone you would have thought was attractive. If you think this is a good way to boost your social status, you probably aren&#8217;t as progressive as you think you are.
