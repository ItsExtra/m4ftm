<p id="mcetoc_1dl0d6jqn0">This website was created because when I talk to cis (non trans) gay/bi guys online or in real life, there is a lot of nervousness and uncertainty when it comes to the possibilities of playing with trans guys. Some guys feel that being with a trans man means <a href="http://m4ftm.com/2016/02/22/q-if-i-fuck-an-ftm-am-i-still-gay/">they aren't really gay</a>. Some would like to, but are nervous because they don't know what to expect and don't know what they would even <em>do</em> with a trans guy. This leads to pretty severe performance anxiety. To someone who has always, or mostly, only fucked people with a body quite similar to their own, trying something new can be daunting.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1dl0d6jqn2">Goals</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Provide a sexy and educational place where gay/bi/queer cis men can learn about fucking and hooking up gay/bi/queer trans men</li>
 	<li>Dispel myths about trans men</li>
 	<li>Use language and media that are accessible to a variety of audiences</li>
 	<li>Represent diverse experiences and realities of trans men</li>
 	<li>Incorporate feedback from trans and gay communities as appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1dl0d6jqn3">What do you think?</h2>
If you are a cis or trans guy who has some experience or thoughts, and you think you have something to add, or a correction to make, <a href="http://m4ftm.com/about-m4ftm/beta-feedback/">please leave feedback</a>. If you are a cis guy and there is something you would like to have covered, you can <a href="http://m4ftm.com/ask-a-question/">ask a question</a> and maybe we will cover it in the future.
