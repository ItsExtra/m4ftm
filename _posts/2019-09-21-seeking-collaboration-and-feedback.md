This project is off to a good start, but could really benefit from input from other people with more diverse experience.
<p id="mcetoc_1dl0d55d90">I am open to a variety of levels of engagement from proof-reader to co-admin.</p>
In particular some "peer review" would be helpful regarding the content. I tried my best to include all the main kinds of sex I have seen mentioned on websites and apps, but some of them I am much less familiar with that others, so I just did my best. If you have insight into any of the following, which I'm especially weak on, I'd love to hear from you:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/bottoming-to-a-trans-guy/">Topping</a> <em>as</em> a trans man, especially <a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/getting-fucked-in-the-ass-by-a-trans-man/">strap ons</a> and <a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/sucking-a-trans-mans-dick/">bjs</a></li>
 	<li>Bottoming <em>to</em> a trans man in any capacity</li>
 	<li>Anything from cis guys that I can't notice because of my perspective</li>
</ul>
If there is anything I straight up missed I'd also like to know about it. With a couple of exceptions for completeness, I am trying to limit this <em>only</em> to acts where there might conceivably be a knowledge gap. I also decided not to go for every fetish under the sun, although there is a special page about <a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/kinky-sex-with-trans-guys/">kinky sex</a> (am I missing anything there?), again not all of which I have experience with.

If you are interested in collaborating, here are some things that need to be done
<ul>
 	<li>Write content</li>
 	<li>Edit, proofread etc</li>
 	<li>Provide feedback on content (peer review), brainstorm ideas for writing</li>
 	<li>Make existing content more interesting by finding and adding images, videos, links etc</li>
 	<li>Manage social media and promotion</li>
 	<li>Translation</li>
 	<li>Create other kinds of content: videos, art, podcast etc</li>
</ul>
