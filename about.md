##### Introduction

This website was created because when I talk to cis (non trans) gay/bi guys online or in real life, there is a lot of nervousness and uncertainty when it comes to the possibilities of playing with trans guys. Some guys feel that being with a trans man means [they aren&#8217;t really gay](http://m4ftm.com/2016/02/22/q-if-i-fuck-an-ftm-am-i-still-gay/). Some would like to, but are nervous because they don&#8217;t know what to expect and don&#8217;t know what they would even _do_ with a trans guy. This leads to some pretty severe performance anxiety. To someone who has always, or mostly, only fucked people with a body quite similar to their own, trying something new can be daunting.

##### Goals

  * Provide a sexy and educational place where gay/bi/queer cis men can learn about fucking and hooking up gay/bi/queer trans men
  * Dispel myths about trans men
  * Use language and media that are accessible to a variety of audiences; specifically not make things appear to be extremely complicated and requiring extensive education
  * Represent diverse experiences and realities of trans men
  * Incorporate feedback from trans and gay communities as appropriate

##### A few fast facts

  * Started in the spring of 2016 it has been developed slowly with goal of launching officially in the summer of 2017
  * Currently being run by one person, but [seeking contributors and collaborators](http://m4ftm.com/about-m4ftm/iso-collaboaration-and-feedback/)
  * A money-losing project, no income is being derived from this project and I have no plans for this to change

##### What do you think?

If you are a cis or trans guy who has some experience or thoughts, and you think you have something to add, or a correction to make, [please leave feedback](http://m4ftm.com/about-m4ftm/beta-feedback/). If you are a cis guy and there is something you would like to have covered, you can [ask a question](http://m4ftm.com/ask-a-question/) which can be answered in the [Questions from gay men](http://m4ftm.com/category/questions-from-gay-men/) section.
