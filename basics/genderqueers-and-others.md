There are people who are ostensibly trans men—they were born female and then [transitioned](http://m4ftm.com/basics/what-is-transition/)— who have different identities than just &#8220;male&#8221;. They may identify themselves as genderqueer (GQ), bi gender, two spirited, genderfluid or any number of other terms. For the purposes of this website, I&#8217;m not going to get too much into this  subject. There are lots of resources on the internet about these identities. Some random googling found [Genderqueer and Non-Binary Identities & Terminology](http://genderqueerid.com/gq-terms) as an intro and I&#8217;ll leave you to your resources to find more.

If anyone has any particularly good link or text that should go here, I&#8217;d be happy to hear about it.

The basic rules of interacting with gender-nonconforming people are simple:

  * The [same rules apply](http://m4ftm.com/basics/manners/) as to other trans people
  * It doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t understand. There are things about any other person that you don&#8217;t understand or agree with, and you just have to live with it. If I think my friend&#8217;s husband is a jerk I don&#8217;t just start calling her by her maiden name and pretending I don&#8217;t know she&#8217;s married, even though I don&#8217;t think she should be. If you need to understand the phenomena better, there is loads on the internet.
  * If somebody&#8217;s presentation (the way they dress, talk, act etc) is so ambiguous that you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on, ask them &#8220;what pronouns do you prefer?&#8221; which is what you need to know to interact with them. What you _don&#8217;t_ need to know is &#8220;are you a man or a woman?&#8221; &#8220;what _are_ you?&#8221; or anything like that.
  * Call them by the name and pronouns they request of you, if they make such a request. Mostly commonly in my experience, people want to be called &#8220;they&#8221; instead of &#8220;he&#8221; or &#8220;she&#8221;. OK. It&#8217;s not so difficult after a very short practice period to get that right. Just do it.
