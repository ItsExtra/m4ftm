It's especially important when dealing with trans folks, because many of us have unusual relationships with our bodies. Making assumptions isn't a good idea about some things in particular. TO make sure everyone has a good time, here are some hints.</p><h1>Body parts</h1><p>Some trans people are sensitive about the words used to describe their bodies. There can be an awful lot of emotional baggage there. For trans men, the safest thing is to use the same language he does, or just ask if he has a preference. Words that have a “feminine” connotation are the ones most likely to be uncool: pussy, cunt, vagina, vulva, vajayajay, clit, tits, boobs. Some trans guys use “masculine” words to describe their bodies, like cock, dick, balls, chest. Others use neutral terms like front hole or just front. Also, some trans guys might not like gendered language like “bitch” or “slut” if you are into that kind of thing. But then again, some do like all of the above. So you should ask.</p><p>If this feels like "walking on eggshells" to you, just consider that lots of people are annoyed or upset by certain words. If you were fucking someone and he referred to your genitals as your "peepee" or "Mr. Littlensoft", what would that do for you? (Unless you have a fetish that makes these turn-ons of course!) Some people refer to an asshole and rectum as a "shitter" but others find being reminded of defecation in the middle of screwing to be a boner killer. Clinical language like "scrotum" and "testicals" makes some feel awkward and unsexy, while others prefer it. Sometimes a certain use of language can remind a person of an ex they had a painful breakup with, or someone who treated them badly. The point is that nothing here is different from anyone else, other than having a head start on predicting things that could be problems.</p><p>To find out about this, you can ask direct questions like, "are there any words you don't like to describe your body?" or "what do you call your vagina?". You can also pick up from the conversation when you ask him about other things what he likes. If he mentions "stroking my dick" or "a dildo in my vagina" those would both be good signs.</p><h2>Asking about it</h2><p>You'll notice on this website that every page says something along the lines of "but you should probably ask him". Is that a mood killer? Does it turn hooking up into a game of 20,000 questions with an intake form and boxes to check? I don't think so.</p><p>Since I switched from fucking straight guys to gay guys, I have been really impressed with the communication about sex most homos are comfortable with. "What are you into?" is a ubiquitous question that's asked really early on, by most men. This is a welcome change from straight guys, many of whom don't think to ask, and who can't really give a good answer if you ask them. Seriously, ask your straight female friends how their discussions of sex have gone and compare notes.</p><p>That's to say, if you are a gay guy who is used to setting up sex on apps and websites, <em>you are probably already doing this</em>. Just keep doing what you've been doing. "What are you into?" is a great question, and should get you a lot of the info you want to know. "Is there anything you are really NOT into?" is a good followup.</p><p><strong>Trans men know themselves, and they know what they are getting into when they seek hook ups.</strong></p><p>They aren't going to wait for you to ask every single question possible. By the time you get to picking whose place, or which park/vehicle/bathhouse, to meet up in, they should be upfront about things that bother them if those are obvious possibilities for them. A person who, for instance, doesn't ever take off his shirt during sex and doesn't want you touching his chest (which is no uncommon), should be self-aware enough to find a moment to tell you this if you are arranging for sex in a location where this is something that would likely happen. The reason this is mentioned here is so you aren't <em>shocked</em> by this request, and it doesn't prompt you to launch into a long line of <em>very unsexy</em> questioning about his reasons.  (He might choose to share this, but an interrogation is usually not the order of the day.) You can just think, "OK, he will leave his shirt on, I'll concentrate elsewhere" <em>or</em> "nipples are the hottest and most important part of a man's body and there's no reason to bother getting together if this is off the table". If the latter, you have saved both of you a time-wasting and awkward (if not disturbing) encounter by calling it off. If the former, you are better equipped to get horned up for the hot time you <em>are</em> going to share together, thinking about other body parts.</p><p>Once you've narrowed things down a bit and found what your mutual interests are, you can ask more specific questions that are relevant. If he's gonna give you a no recip bj, you don't really need to know what words he likes to describe his font hole. Just don't mention it unless he does.</p></div></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/ask-a-question.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> ask-a-question</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/ask-a-question.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> ask-a-question </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
