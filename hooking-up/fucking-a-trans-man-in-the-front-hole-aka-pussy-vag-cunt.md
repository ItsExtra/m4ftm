# Fucking a trans man in the front hole (aka pussy, vag, cunt)

The mysterious vagina... Actually, it's not that mysterious. It's just a little pocket in front of the asshole. If a guy has not had surgery to remove it, you can put your fingers in all the way to feel a hard thing like the tip of a nose toward the top. That's the cervix, and it closes the tube. Unlike your asshole, the vag doesn't go on forever and ever. Also unlike the asshole, it doesn't require maintenance like douching and paying attention to diet. Front holes are always ready for action whenever the guy is.Even first thing in the morning after coffee!

Cunt holes can be different sizes. Some trans guys have small tight pussies while others can take a couple of fists. Just like anal, you should ask about whatever you want to know.

## What it feels like in a pussy

The inside of a cunt feels like the inside of your cheek wrapped around you. One guy I was with who'd never felt one before said "it's like a mouth with no teeth" and no need to stop for air. Unlike your asshole, there are not sphincter muscles. Where an ass has two sets of rings at the bottom, and is kind of open after that, a cunt is like a big smooth muscle all the way up. Trans guys can learn to control the muscles of their cunts by doing Kegal exercises. By squeezing different muscles inside a trans guy can produce lovely effects on a cock. Someone who is on testosterone has generally more muscle than someone who is not, and the cunt gets stronger along with the rest of the body.

**Juice** is produced in different amounts by different cunts. In general, T can lower the production of pussy juice. Don't take a dry cunt to mean he isn't turned on and into you! Water or silicon based lube is always your friend, and if nothing else, at least use some spit when doing anything in or around this hole. Relube often, dryness is quite unpleasant.  On the other hand, some guys might make a lot of juice (think of it as precum), and things can get pretty soaked by guys who "squirt" when they cum. (No, he did not pee all over your bed!) Not all guys do this, and the ones who do don't always do it. When it happens, it's hot for everyone. If you are worried about having to sleep in a puddle after an evening of fun, ask him if he's likely to get really wet, and get some towels or soaker pads as needed.

## Rock hard cunts

Getting him hard is obviously going to be individual. Trans guys like the same sorts of things other guys do, and you can find out the same ways, either by talking, or gently trying things and watching for his reaction. Like anyone, they might not get hard quickly, or at all. Trans guys don't pop boners the way cis guys do, and so depending on the pants and the guy, you might not be able to feel a hard cock through his clothes.

So how do you tell if a trans guy is aroused? If everything is totally new to you, you can ask him to show you the different stages as they, er, come up. The change is more dramatic on some than others. In general, an aroused cunt is hot and swollen. There is erectile tissue behind the clit and the labia, which runs down both sides towards the hole. When hard this tissue fills up with blood and pushes the clit up and out. The lips will also have more blood going to them and the whole thing opens like a beautiful, hairy flower that smells like balls. You can also pay attention for other signs they are having a good time: A flushed face, rapid breathing, happy sounds, his words, enthusiastic engagement with you, rubbing his crotch against you etc.

**Positioning** for front sex is slightly different angles than anal but you'll figure it out pretty quick. Just like any sex, the poses you see in porn are chosen because they look hot on your screen, not because they feel the best for the performers. Ask your partner what positions he likes. Missionary and doggie style are a couple of classics to start from.

## Making it good for him

  * Like anyone, he may want to be jerked or rubbed by himself or you while you are fucking him. Some guys like a vibe. Most pussies won't cum _just_ from being fucked, although it can happen.
  * Some guys like to have toys or fingers in or on their assholes while being fucked in the front.
  * Cunts don't usually need to be loosened up the same way some assholes do, but the more turned on he is, the hotter and tighter he will be, and both of you will have more pleasure.
  * A good bet is aiming your cock towards his belly button, which is the direction you'll find the "g spot" which is similar to the prostate.
  * Some guys don't like the sensation of a cock banging up against their cervix. If this is happening (he will tell you!) shift positions a bit until it feels good again.

If you have a friend (or two) to join you, you might want to make use of both holes at the same time like these guys:

## Front hole health and safety

  * Pussy juice can carry all the STIs semen can (including HIV, though in lower quantities), so protect yourself with a condom and/or PREP as required.
  * The vag is self-cleaning, but can get out of balance sometimes. Yeast and BV are two common problems. Yeast can be contagious but usually isn't and both are easily solved by medications. Neither is considered an STI, they are just things that happen sometimes.
  * Female urethras (pee holes) are located between the hole and the clit. If you look close, you can see it. Because the tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the world is shorter than when it goes through a penis, infections are easier to catch. To keep your trans buddy safe, try to avid getting anything from his ass near his pisshole. His chances of getting an infection are reduced if he urinates after playtime.
  * Female bodies are less likely to show symptoms of STIs even when someone has contracted something. You can't tell by sight, smell or taste that someone does _not_ have an STI. Things you might see that could be signs he should get to a clinic include: bad smell, green discharge, warts, redness, itchiness, unexplained bleeding. Genital herpes is a very common STI and once you get it, it's your friend for life. Just like with cis men, a condom only protects the part is covers.
  * Trans men who have not had their reproductive organs removed may be able to get pregnant. Being on T is _not_ considered a method of contraception. If you want to leave your load in someone's pussy, you need to have a plan to avoid knocking him up, and/or discuss what you would do if he got preggers. Trans men can take the injectable depo provera to protect them from pregnancy along with their T. Other options include IUDs, diaphragms, "female" condoms and sponges. If you are in good control of your cumming, pulling out works pretty well too, but _know thyself_!
  * Usually, someone who is on testosterone doesn't have periods anymore. However, it is possible for a variety of reasons that there could be blood in the front hole if they've not had a hysterectomy. In the off-chance that this happens, let the guy know, but don't panic about it.
