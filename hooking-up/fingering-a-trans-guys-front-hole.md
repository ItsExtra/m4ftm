If someone wants you to put your fingers in his front hole, make sure you have nice short nails without sharp bits, clean hands and lubricant. Front holes and back holes have different muscles, with the front lacking the sphincter muscles that can be pulled closed tight on sure people. While a lot of people need slow warm up for anal sex starting with one finger and working up, this might not be necessary for a pussy. You can probably go to two fingers quickly if not right away.

A lot of guys assume that the best thing to do is imitate a penis, and start jack hammering in and out. While jackhammers have their place,Â you'll have better luck trying to hit the &#8220;G spot&#8221;. Like the prostate, the G spot is located two or three inches inside toward the front. You might not actually feel anything special. But you will be able to tell if you found the right spot from your partner's reaction. If this is something they enjoy, they can help you fingerbang them just right.

The easiest way to find the G spot is to have your partner lie or sit with his legs open and knees bent. Face each other and put your index and middle finger inside him (your palm is facing up) Then move your fingers inside him like you were signalling to someone to &#8220;come here.&#8221; Adjust the angle, speed and pressure while you listen, watch and feel his reactions. This position will let you use the thumb of the same hand to rub his cock head too. You can also have him touch himself, or someone can use a vibrator at the same time.
