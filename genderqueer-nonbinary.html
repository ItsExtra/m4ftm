               <p>There are people who are ostensibly trans men—they were born female and then <a href="http://m4ftm.com/basics/what-is-transition/">transitioned</a>— who have different identities than just "male". They may identify themselves as genderqueer (GQ), bi gender, two spirited, genderfluid or any number of other terms. For the purposes of this website, I'm not going to get too much into this  subject. There are lots of resources on the internet about these identities.

<p>If anyone has any particularly good link or text that should go here, I'd be happy to hear about it.</p>
<p>The basic rules of interacting with gender-nonconforming people are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://m4ftm.com/basics/manners/">same rules apply</a> as to other trans people</li>
<li>It doesn't matter if you don't understand. There are things about any other person that you don't understand or agree with, and you just have to live with it. If I think my friend's husband is a jerk I don't just start calling her by her maiden name and pretending I don't know she's married, even though I don't think she should be. If you need to understand the phenomena better, there is loads on the internet.</li>
<li>If somebody's presentation (the way they dress, talk, act etc) is so ambiguous that you don't know what's going on, ask them "what pronouns do you prefer?" which is what you need to know to interact with them. What you <em>don't</em> need to know is "are you a man or a woman?" "what <em>are</em> you?" or anything like that.</li>
<li>Call them by the name and pronouns they request of you, if they make such a request. Mostly commonly in my experience, people want to be called "they" instead of "he" or "she". OK. It's not so difficult after a very short practice period to get that right. Just do it.</li>
</ul>
