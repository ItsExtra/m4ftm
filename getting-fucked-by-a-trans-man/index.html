Not so! Many trans men like to top, either some or all of the time.</p><h2>Strap ons</h2><p>It can be as big or small as you want, and never gets soft. Power bottoms and size queens line up here! You can use any dildo with a suction or flared base (like <a href="http://www.priape.com/en/king-cock-10-dildo-with-balls.html">this one</a>) if he has a strap-on harness. Bring your favourite friend from your nightstand.</p><p>Strap on cocks have been around <em>forever</em> (check out the <a href="http://www.thatposition.com/blog/august-2014/history-of-strap-on-sex">12,000 year old one</a> from Japan!) and are available in a variety of styles. A lot of trans guys who top will have one (or more) already, but because they can be pricey they might not. If you want him to fuck you and he doesn't have one, why not buy him one as a gift? But make sure you consult him first, the fit, material and construction of these things has to be chosen carefully and taste vary.</p><p><del>there was a picture here</del></p><p></p><p>It's also very likely that your trans top man has at least one, if not a small library of dicks to plough you with. Your asshole can be like Goldilocks. Most harnesses are pretty quick to swap toys, so if you get greedy and want to size up part way through, you can. Or you can go smaller and give your hole a rest.</p><p>Vibrators can be added to strap ons. They can go close to his junk, and you can also get vibrating strap on dildos if you like that feeling.</p><p><del>there was a picture here</del></p><p></p><h2>Safer strapping</h2><p>In my opinion you should always use a condom on a toy, cause it's going in your ass. But if you don't want to, you should use a brand new toy that will only ever be used for you, or a 100% silicone toy which can be boiled to sterilize it. Other toys which are <strong>non-porous</strong> and can be sterilized in this way are glass and steel, although these aren't typically used with straps. Careful with weasel words on labels like "silicone blend" or anything other than 100%. Some trans guys like big soft realistic dildos which are usually not silicone, because it's difficult to make silicone feel like flesh. Always use a condom with these.</p><p>Unlike HIV, which dies very quickly upon leaving the body, hepatitis can live for months on toys if they are not made of a non porous material and properly cleaned. You may have been <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/hepb/">vaccinated for Hepatitis B</a> as an infant or around age 13, depending where you grew up. You may have also had <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/hepa/default.htm">Hepatitis A vaccine</a> somewhere along the way, although it's not routinely given by most public health authorities. It is commonly given in travel vaccine clinics. Hep A and B are sometimes given together in a formulation called <a href="http://www.polaristravelclinic.ca/why-should-i-bother-getting-a-twinrix-shot/">Twinrix</a>. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/Populations/PDFs/HepGay-FactSheet.pdf">All gay and bi men should have the Hep A and B vaccines</a>, which are a safe and effective way to protect your liver and general health. If you aren't sure, you may be able to get the series of three doses of the Hep B vaccine freely or cheaply from your primary care provider. Hep A is not free in most place, but well worth considering if your insurance will cover it, or if you can afford it (it's not terribly expensive). You can also have bloodwork done to see if you've already had the vaccines if you don't have all your records.If you go to a sexual health clinic for STI screening, they might be able to run this test at the same time.</p><p>Harnesses should be reasonably cared for according to their material, but don't need to be boiled or anything between bottoms.</p><h2>Dry humping</h2><p>Not just for teeangers! He can grind his crotch against you to pleasure himself and you can be jerked off, fingered, or anything else. Try wearing a but plug while he pushes against your ass.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on Sep 17, 2019</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured-posts"><li><div><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/beta-feedback/" class="featured-posts__title">Beta Site Feedback</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2019-09-17T19:21">Sep 17, 2019</time></div></li><li><div><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/seeking-collaboaration-and-feedback/" class="featured-posts__title">Seeking collaboration and feedback </a><time class="u-small" datetime="2019-09-17T19:21">Sep 17, 2019</time></div></li><li><div><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/site-to-do-list/" class="featured-posts__title">Site To Do List</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2019-09-17T19:21">Sep 17, 2019</time></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/tags/about/">About</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/tags/drafts/">drafts</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li><li><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/tags/help-wanted/">Help wanted</a> <span class="u-small">(3)</span></li><li><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/tags/to-update-links/">To update: links</a> <span class="u-small">(1)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/"><img src="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/media/website/170605-icon-150px.png" alt="m4ftm"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="https://twitter.com/m4ftm" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-center">Generated by <a href="https://getpublii.com/">Publii</a>.
