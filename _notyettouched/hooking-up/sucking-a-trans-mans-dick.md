Lots of trans guys love a good bj.Like anyone else, they can tell you what they like, but here are a few pointers to get you started.

If you've eaten women or trans guys who are not on T you will notice some differences:

  * More hair (depending on genetics)
  * Smell is more musky
  * Head is bigger: generally from the size of a chick pea up to the size of a thumb
  * Stronger musculature

Tips:

  * If you are new to this, make sure there is some light so you can see what you are doing. Ask him to point out the landmarks if he is comfortable.
  * Many trans guys enjoy a sucking feeling on their cock heads. Use a similar technique as when you are sucking any cock.
  * He might enjoy being fingered or toyed in either or both holes at the same time and being sucked, but he might not. This is something to ask about before diving in. Just like some cis (non trans) guys won't appreciate a surprise finger in the butt, lots of trans guys will be upset if you penetrate them without the OK first.
  * Stubble can be really uncomfortable on the thighs and junk. Shave just before you are planning to play. If you have a beard or haven't been able to shave, try to avoid scratching so your partner doesn't end up all red and raw.
  * If you need a rest from sucking or want to do something different, use your thumb, fingers or other body parts to create a similar rubbing to whatever your partner was enjoying.

**Sucking a strap on**

A trans guy might like you to suck a prosthetic cock he's wearing with a strap. While he won't feel your mouth directly, there are things you can do to make him feel good:

  * Use your mouth and hands to create pressure on his body. The dildo is usually positioned so it's on top of his head and shaft, so he will feel it when you move it around.
  * Get into the fantasy of it. Sex is 90% mental. Treat his cock like the extension of his body that it is. Show him and tell him that you're hungry for his cock.

On SugarButch, a woman who enjoys sucking strapped on cock wrote a blog post [Ask Me Anything: How to Give Blow Jobs Without Feeling Stupid](http://www.sugarbutch.net/2011/08/ask-me-anything-how-to-give-blow-jobs-without-feeling-stupid/) with some tips you might find helpful.

**Safer oral**

Giving oral sex to a front hole and cock is considered pretty safe. You can get the same skin-to-skin stuff as in any situation: herpes, warts, syphilis, and (I believe) chlamydia and Gonorrhea. There is also a miniscule risk of contracting HIV that way but it is very, very low. There is an item called a [dental dam](http://meatincorporated.blogspot.ca/2007/10/1024-dental-dam-awareness-day.html) which can be obtained, but I have never in my whole life heard of anyone actually using one. And I've asked a lot of people, even some who go around telling others to use them for their jobs.
