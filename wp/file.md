# Title

understood how transition worked, and that I could be a man. When I was a kid, I was really puzzled why I wasn't attracted to girls. I actually tried pretty hard. I felt I should be. Gay. I was gay. But  I wasn't even a little bit bisexual. I kept thinking of myself as gay. I had the gayest sex I could with the str8 boys available to me. I loved bi guys, that felt much more legit.
