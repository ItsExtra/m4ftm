               <h2> </h2>
<h2>What is an FTM?</h2>
<p>FTM stands for "female to male" and is a common term on hookup sites and apps to describe a person who was (usually) raised as a girl because of having female body parts, but at some point in life decided to <a href="http://m4ftm.com/what-is-transition/">transition</a> to male.</p>
<p>Others terms you might see used are things like tboy, f2m, trans guy/man/boy.</p>
<h2>What is transition?</h2>
<p>We use the term <em>transition</em> to describe a decision to stop living as one gender and switch to another one. For any trans person, transition can include any combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing name, legally or not</li>
<li>Changing our legal gender on government documents (not possible for all people in all places)</li>
<li>Dressing, grooming, styling hair etc in the style that presents us the way we want</li>
<li>Asking people we know to use the right pronouns (eg switching from "she" to "he")</li>
<li>Changing voice, tone, manner of speaking to better reflect personality</li>
<li>Seek out roles in family, work and community which reflect the desired gender</li>
<li>Medical treatments and procedures</li>
</ul>
<h2>Body modifications</h2>
<p>Many trans people have some some sort of medical intervention to help them look and feel better in their bodies. Not all people have or want to have the same things done, for all kinds of reasons: price, safety, uncertainty of results, and because not all of us desire to have exactly the same kind of body. Like all people, we have different feelings about our bodies. A feature of one trans person's body that causes them lots of distress (a feeling called <em>dysphoria</em>) could be something another one loves about themselves.</p>
<h2>The big T</h2>
<p>Taking testosterone is the #1 most common intervention trans men seek out. Most trans men are on, have been on, or will be on it. (Some people cannot take it, or have to stop taking it, for medical reasons.) Testosterone is a cheap, easy, well-understood, safe and fairly fool-proof way  to completely change the way we look, sound, feel, taste and smell.</p>
<p>The most common way of taking T is a weekly or bi weekly injection, generally of about 0.5mL of juice which we give ourselves, or have someone else do. There are other kinds, like longer-acting injections and topical creams. But injection is what most opt for.</p>
<p>When a trans man starts taking T, he's usually started on a low dose and tapered up. Starting in a few weeks he slowly goes through a second puberty for the next couple of years.</p>
<p>T does to the female body pretty much the same thing as it does to the male body, just later in life. If taken after the first puberty is finished, it doesn't affect the bones, so trans men don't get any taller, bigger feet or other changes to the skeleton. However the effects of T are pretty substantial. You can read all about it at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_(female-to-male)">wikipedia</a>, but here are the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Body hair grows in a typically male pattern according to you genetics</li>
<li>Depending on age and genetics, might have male pattern baldness</li>
<li>Voice lowers</li>
<li>Fat and muscle redistribute in a male pattern (butt gets smaller, shoulders get bigger etc) including changes in the face that give more male contours</li>
<li>Periods go away</li>
<li>Smell like a man</li>
<li>Junk gets bigger than it was</li>
<li>Skin and hair texture change to be rougher with more prominent veins</li>
<li>Acne</li>
</ul>
<p>After 6 months to 2 years on T, most trans men "pass" 100%. That means we look exactly like any other man. Other than tending to be short, there is no way to tell if a man you see on the street is trans or not.</p>
<h2>Sex changes</h2>
<p>When starting on T, sex drive goes <em>way</em> up, especially at the beginning (you remember what being a teenager was like!). Some people find that their sexuality changes significantly when starting on hormones. Changes in who they are attracted to, what activities they want or enjoy, how their bodies feel and what turns them on are common. And of course, the psychological effect of feeling better in their body can also have a huge effect.</p>
<p>Trans men who take T usually develop a more male sexual response. The way we think about sex changes to be like men. We are more likely to get turned on seeing a hottie in the street than we were before. Sex can become a top priority to someone who didn't feel that way before. Porn might become more interesting. We can be quicker to arouse.</p>
<p>T affects the physical structures of our genitals. The extent of these changes is different between people, but our junk is not the same as a woman's. Changes that can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clit grows bigger</li>
<li>Less juice</li>
<li>Smell like balls instead of like a cunt</li>
<li>More hair</li>
<li>Darker colour</li>
</ul>
<h2>Have you had the surgery? </h2>
<p>When some people hear "trans", what they first think of is "sex change surgery." That term is outdated and now called "gender reassignment" or (even more modern) "gender confirmation" surgery.</p>
<p>While the most obvious kind of surgery is performed on the genitals, a lot of trans men choose not to have this done, or are not able to access it if they do want it. There is in fact no such thing as "the surgery" for either trans men or trans women.</p>
<p>You have probably heard the term "pre op" to describe a trans person who has not had any surgical procedures, and "post op" to describe one that has. These terms aren't very useful though. "Pre op" assumes that someone is going to have surgery some day, which may or may not be the case. "Post op" just isn't very descriptive. As you will see, there are various different procedures, which can be performed in different combinations and orders.</p>
<h2>Top surgery</h2>
<p><em>Top surgery</em> is what we call removing, reducing, and reshaping the tissue of our chests. There are various techniques depending on the body shape and individual's desires and priorities. Top surgery is probably the most common surgical procedure for trans guys, and the goal is to change the shape of the chest to be more typically male. Here's a picture of someone who has had top surgery and taken T:</p>
<p><del>there was a picture here</del></p>
<p>One thing you should know about top surgery is that it can reduce or even eliminate nipple sensation. If nipple play is important to you, you can ask about this.</p>
<h2>Bottom Surgery</h2>
<p>Other than top surgery, a trans man may have had some sort of <em>bottom surgery</em> also. This could be an internal procedure (hysterectomy or removal of the ovaries) that you wouldn't notice, and/or some sort of genital reconstruction.</p>
<p>I'm not going to get into the different kinds of bottom surgery here. From what I can see on apps and websites around me, not a lot of guys have had them. There are various kinds and outcomes are really different. If a guy has had surgery, he is the best person to tell you about it and what you can expect.</p>
<p>The curious can read details about various procedures at <a href="http://www.ftmguide.org/grs.html">Hudson's FTM Guide</a>.</p>
