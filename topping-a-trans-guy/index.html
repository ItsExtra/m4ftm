For trans men, the safest thing is to use the same language he does, or just ask if he has a preference. Words that have a "feminine" connotation are the ones most likely to be uncool: pussy, cunt, vagina, vulva, clit. Some trans guys use "male" words to describe their bodies, like cock and dick. Others use neutral terms like front hole or just front. Also, some trans guys might not like gendered language like "bitch" or "slut" if you are into that kind of thing. But then again, some do. So you should ask.</p><p>Let's get started:</p><p><a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/fingering-a-trans-guys-front-hole/">Fingering a trans guy's front hole</a></p><p><a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/jerking-off-a-trans-guy/">Jerking off a trans guy</a></p><p>[Getting head from a trans guy](<a href="http://Getting">http://Getting</a> head from a trans guy)</p><p><a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/fucking-a-trans-man-in-the-front-hole-aka-pussy-vag-cunt/">Fucking a trans guy in the front hole (aka pussy, vag or cunt)</a></p><p><a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/fucking-a-transguy-in-the-ass/">Fucking a trans guy in the ass</a></p><p><a href="http://m4ftm.com/hooking-up/kinky-sex-with-trans-guys/">Kinky sex with trans guys</a></p><p><del>there was a picture here</del></p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on Sep 17, 2019</div><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__related box"><h3 class="box__title">Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/getting-head-from-a-trans-guy/" class="inverse">Getting head from a trans guy</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-17T19:22" class="u-small">Sep 17, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/getting-fucked-by-a-trans-man/" class="inverse">Getting fucked by a trans man</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-17T19:22" class="u-small">Sep 17, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/fucking-a-transguy-in-the-ass/" class="inverse">Fucking a transguy in the ass</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-17T19:22" class="u-small">Sep 17, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/"><img src="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/media/website/170605-icon-150px.png" alt="m4ftm"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="m4ftm" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p><p>creative commons something something</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://itsextra.github.io/m4ftm/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=07b53ae91f8045eab042a695e4a26034"></script></body></html>
